States: Indian states and union territories.

Date: The date of the recorded data.

Frequency: Frequency of data collection.

Estimated Unemployment Rate: The unemployment rate (%) for the given state and date.

Estimated Employed: The number of employed individuals.

Estimated Labour Participation Rate: The labor participation rate (%).

Region: The region of India (North, South, East, West, Northeast).

longitude: Longitude of the state.

latitude: Latitude of the state.
